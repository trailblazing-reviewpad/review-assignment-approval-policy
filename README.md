Example of Review Assignment and Approval Policy
## Overview

With Reviewpad, we can define a review assignment and approval policy for a repository. 

This policy is defined in a YAML file named `reviewpad.yaml` and placed in the root of the repository. 

The policy is applied to all pull requests in the repository.
